Velocity Clinical Research announced Wednesday that it's acquired two additional sites – Clarity Clinical Research in New York and Providence Clinical Research in California – bringing its total number of sites to 18 across 12 states. The acquisitions come after Velocity was acquired by a London-based private equity firm, GHO Capital, in April from NaviMed Capital.

> "The capital from our new owners, GHO, has meant Velocity can keep expanding its integrated network of sites at an aggressive pace," Paul Evans, CEO and president of Velocity, said in a statement. "Despite working on our own deal that was only completed in April this year, it has not slowed down our commitment to addressing an incredibly fragmented clinical trial site landscape in the U.S. by creating a fully integrated network. Adding Clarity Clinical Research and Providence Clinical Research to the Velocity network is a testament to that."

Clarity, based in Syracuse, New York, specializes in central nervous system studies, including Alzheimer's and memory-loss research, and is affiliated with a long-term care facility. "Over the past four years we have built up a strong profile within the memory loss therapeutic," Lisa Sonneborn, founder of Clarity, said in a statement. "Integrating with Velocity's network will give us the opportunity to expand our therapeutic abilities and support more patients through clinical research."

Providence is based in North Hollywood, California, and has delivered more than 200 clinical trials across a range of therapeutic areas, such as asthma and diabetes, and has a database of more than 20,000 patients. "The past 12 months have shown that if we get clinical trials done more quickly, we can cut months off the development time for new drugs," Evans said. "The commercial clinical trials sector played a critical role last year in the race to find a Covid vaccine, which is why now is the time to keep growing at a pace and become a dedicated partner for sponsors in both the U.S. and soon Europe, who want fast patient recruitment and data delivery."

Evans, a former Quintiles executive, has previously said he expects to get Velocity's number of sites up to 25 pretty quickly, possibly by the end of 2021.
