      Clinical Trials are a crucial part of finding new medicines and treatments
      for diseases. There are many reasons why people volunteer to participate
      in clinical trials. You may have the opportunity to play a role in the
      development of new treatments, devices or preventions for certain diseases
      or medical conditions. You may have access to investigational treatments
      before they are available. You may have access to free diagnostic
      procedures or medical tests related to the clinical trial and be
      compensated for your time and travel related to the trial. Participation
      is always voluntary.

          <p>Clinical research is the study of health and illness in humans, in both sick and healthy people. It focuses on improving knowledge of diseases, developing diagnostic methods and new treatments or medical devices to ensure better patient care. Clinical research trials are carefully designed, reviewed and completed, and must be approved before they can start.</p>
          <p>All clinical research must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>have the goal of increasing medical knowledge</li>
            <li>be carried out by competent persons take all necessary measures to protect those who lend themselves to research</li>

        <div class="animate fade-up editable">
          <p>A clinical research trial is a scientific study that helps determine how a new medicine or treatment works in humans. Clinical research trials are conducted to obtain information used to determine the safety and effectiveness of a new drug, device, or treatment. The US FDA must review information from these clinical trials and then decide if the drug, device, or treatment should be approved and made available to patients on the market. The FDA has strict rules that govern how clinical trials are conducted. These rules are designed to ensure the safety of those who participate.</p>
