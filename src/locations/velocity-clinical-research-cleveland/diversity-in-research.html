  - question: Racial and Ethnic Minorities in Clinical Trials - FDA.gov
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Clinical trials are research studies that determine whether medical
      products like medicines, vaccines, or devices are safe and effective for
      people. Participants in clinical trials should represent the patients that
      will be using the medical products, though this is often not the case.
      Racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials. This
      is a concern because people of different ages, races, and ethnicities may
      react differently to medical products. If you think a clinical trial may
      be right for you, talk to your doctor.</p>

  - question: What is informed consent?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Informed consent consists of a document and a process. The informed
      consent document provides a summary of the trial, including its purpose,
      the treatment procedures and schedule, potential risks and benefits, and
      alternative treatments. It also explains your rights as a clinical trial
      participant. If you decide to enter the trial, you give your official
      consent by signing the document. Even after signing the informed consent,
      you may leave the trial at any time and are given the opportunity to
      discuss alternative treatments with medical staff.</p><p>The informed
      consent process provides you with information to help you make an educated
      decision about participating in a trial.&nbsp; Before you make your
      decision, the site research team will discuss the trial. You will have
      opportunities to ask questions before, during and after the trial.</p>

          <p>It is crucial that research participants reflect the whole population, including meaningful data from groups of every age, race, ethnicity, gender, and health group. Without this representation the benefits of research innovations and medical advancements may not support the quality of care of those populations.</p>
