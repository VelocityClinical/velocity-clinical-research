  - question: Racial and Ethnic Minorities in Clinical Trials - FDA.gov
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Clinical trials are research studies that determine whether medical
      products like medicines, vaccines, or devices are safe and effective for
      people. Participants in clinical trials should represent the patients that
      will be using the medical products, though this is often not the case.
      Racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials. This
      is a concern because people of different ages, races, and ethnicities may
      react differently to medical products. If you think a clinical trial may
      be right for you, talk to your doctor.</p>
  - question: Who can participate in a clinical trial?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>All clinical trials have criteria that define who can participate. The
      factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical trial are called
      &ldquo;inclusion criteria&rdquo; and those that disallow someone from
      participating are called &ldquo;exclusion criteria&rdquo;. These criteria
      are based on such factors as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease,
      previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Before joining a
      clinical trial, a participant must qualify for the study.</p><p>Some
      research studies seek participants with specific illnesses or conditions,
      while others need healthy participants. It is important to note that
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are not used to reject people personally.
      Instead, the criteria are used to identify appropriate participants and
      keep them safe. The criteria help ensure that researchers will be able to
      answer the questions they plan to study.</p>
  - question: What is protocol?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>A protocol is a written, detailed plan of a study that all research
      sites follow.&nbsp; It outlines criteria that eligible volunteers must
      meet in order to participate in a study. Protocols also describe the
      schedule, procedures, medications, dosages, and length of the study.</p>
  - question: What is informed consent?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Informed consent consists of a document and a process. The informed
      consent document provides a summary of the trial, including its purpose,
      the treatment procedures and schedule, potential risks and benefits, and
      alternative treatments. It also explains your rights as a clinical trial
      participant. If you decide to enter the trial, you give your official
      consent by signing the document. Even after signing the informed consent,
      you may leave the trial at any time and are given the opportunity to
      discuss alternative treatments with medical staff.</p><p>The informed
      consent process provides you with information to help you make an educated
      decision about participating in a trial.&nbsp; Before you make your
      decision, the site research team will discuss the trial. You will have
      opportunities to ask questions before, during and after the trial.</p>

          What is clinical research?
        </h5>
        <div class="editable animate fade-up">
          <p>Clinical research is the study of health and illness in humans, in both sick and healthy people. It focuses on improving knowledge of diseases, developing diagnostic methods and new treatments or medical devices to ensure better patient care. Clinical research trials are carefully designed, reviewed and completed, and must be approved before they can start.</p>
          <p>All clinical research must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>have the goal of increasing medical knowledge</li>
            <li>be carried out by competent persons take all necessary measures to protect those who lend themselves to research</li>
            <li>obtain regulatory approvals and take all the necessary legal and ethical steps</li>
            <li>collect the consent of those involved in research</li>

          Why should I participate?
        </h5>
        <div class="editable animate fade-up">
          <p>Clinical Trials are a crucial part of finding new medicines and treatments for diseases. There are many reasons why people volunteer to participate in clinical trials. You may have the opportunity to play a role in the development of new treatments, devices or preventions for certain diseases or medical conditions. You may have access to investigational treatments before they are available. You may have access to free diagnostic procedures or medical tests related to the clinical trial and be compensated for your time and travel related to the trial.</p>

          <p>A clinical research trial is a scientific study that helps determine how a new medicine or treatment works in humans. Clinical research trials are conducted to obtain information used to determine the safety and effectiveness of a new drug, device, or treatment. The US FDA must review information from these clinical trials and then decide if the drug, device, or treatment should be approved and made available to patients on the market. The FDA has strict rules that govern how clinical trials are conducted. These rules are designed to ensure the safety of those who participate.</p>
