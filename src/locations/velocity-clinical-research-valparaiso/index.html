    bio_html: >-
      <p>Mark Yarosz, MS, PT graduated from the University of Indianapolis in
      1999 with a master&rsquo;s degree in physical therapy. He worked as a
      physical therapist and rehabilitation team leader for five years until he
      was approached by Dr. Buynak and asked if he would be interested working
      in clinical research. Mark found his passion and has been working in
      clinical research ever since. He worked for 15 years as Site Director of
      Northwest Indiana Center for Clinical Research / Buynak Clinical Research
      which became part of Velocity Clinical Research in early 2020.</p><p>Mark
      started working in clinical research because it was an exciting new
      challenge in a field where he could continue making a difference in the
      lives of patients. During the past 15 years he has been fortunate to be a
      small part of many clinical trials that later went on to improve the lives
      of thousands of people. As part of Velocity, he looks forward to growing
      his site to expand clinical trials access for the residents of Northwest
      Indiana and surrounding communities.</p><p>Mark is originally from
      Pennsylvania and is an avid fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He has been
      married to his wife Jill for 13 years and they have four children and a
      very loud hound dog. Mark dreamed of becoming a Paleontologist when he was
      young and now loves fishing, gardening, hiking at the Indiana Dunes
      lakeshore, rock collecting, and metal detecting. He also enjoys
      vacationing in Maine, Door County, WI or at the Outer Banks of North
      Carolina.</p>
