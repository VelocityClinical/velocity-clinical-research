        <div class="animate fade-up editable">
          <p>Velocity Boise was founded in 1991 as the first free-standing clinical research facilities in the state of Idaho.  This site’s initial focus was on clinical studies for treatment of infectious diseases, participating in antibiotic trials across a wide range of indications.  Over the following years, Boise developed expertise and capabilities to become a significant site for conducting vaccine trials and clinical trials for chronic medical conditions.</p>
          <p>Velocity Boise is located in Meridian, just west of the city of Boise and easily accessible to the entire metropolitan area known as the Treasure Valley.  This area contains Idaho’s three largest cities, Boise, Meridian and Nampa whose combined population makes it the most populous in the state. The Boise facility is located just off a major highway and less than one mile from a regional hospital.</p>
          <p>The Boise team is committed to being a resource for study volunteers, to providing the highest quality of patient care with compassion and kindness and to advancing medicine though research.  By becoming part of the Velocity Clinical Research organization in 2019, they added new efficiencies and integration to their already comprehensive approaches to conducting clinical trials. </p>
