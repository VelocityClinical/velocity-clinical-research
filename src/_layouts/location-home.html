        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Velocity Clinical Austin, founded as an independent clinical research in January of 2019, is one of the newest Velocity sites. It was started with a core team of experienced research staff from the Idaho location and has expanded to form a robust research team. Austin provides expertise in a wide range of therapeutic indications specific to a geriatric population, including dementia, osteoporosis and other chronic conditions. By developing close working relationships with area retirement communities and having recruiters trained in the nuances of elderly participants, Austin enrolls a high number of patients over the age of 65.</p>
        <p>Conveniently located in Cedar Park, just north of Austin, this site offers ease of access from major highways without the congestion of downtown traffic. Ample patient parking is available. Austin is located less than one mile from EMT services and less than 5 miles from a regional hospital.</p>
        <p>The Austin team is committed to being a resource for study volunteers, to providing the highest quality of patient care with compassion and kindness and to advancing medicine though research. By becoming part of the Velocity Clinical Research organization in 2019, they added new efficiencies and integration to their already comprehensive approaches to conducting clinical trials.</p>
