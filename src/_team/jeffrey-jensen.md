Jeff brings a broad range of clinical site experience to Velocity, having spent 8 years on the site services side of the business with Radiant Research and another 8 years as a consultant in the industry. Jeff holds an MBA in Finance and Marketing from the University of Notre Dame and a BA in Finance from the University of Washington.

Although Jeff spends a lot of time crunching numbers and working with the clinics, he never loses focus on why we are here: our patients. “I love this business because I think the Medical Directors and staff at our sites make a positive impact on patient lives. I am proud to have a small role in the drug development process.”

Jeff’s personal time is spent with his wife, two active young boys and two yellow labs. Fatherhood has taught him that even though Gryffindor rules, Slytherin has its charms. He also now knows that “I hope you step on a Lego” is the cruelest of insults.
