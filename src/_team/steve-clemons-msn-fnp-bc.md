Steve joined Velocity Clinical Research in late 2021 and is serving in the role of SVP for Client Delivery after serving as President and CEO of VitaLink Research. &nbsp;He is driven by magical thinking in developing value for clients of all size. &nbsp;In his current role, he is responsible for strategic relationships with our Pharma and CRO partners.

He is an experienced C-suite executive serving in both commercial and operational roles within clinical trial organizations. &nbsp;Having been backed by PE previously, Steve has been deeply involved M&A, standardization of processes, and shown deep experience in the clinical trial site space. &nbsp;He is a dual board certified Family Nurse Practitioner who has taken his background as a clinician into the clinical trial space, driving exceptional results in business growth and significant returns for investors. &nbsp;He is also proud to be a U.S. Navy Veteran.

In his spare time he is either chasing his daughter in the air as a private pilot, or helping his son step into the next race car in another state. &nbsp;He enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and two dogs, but when there not around he is out on his boat “Big Gurl” chasing down fish in the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp;
