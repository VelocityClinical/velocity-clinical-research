Kimberly Ballard joined Velocity’s executive team in 2021 as the Senior Vice President of Human Resources.&nbsp; Bringing more than 25 years of experience in organizational transformation, Kim has built comprehensive HR programs for domestic and international corporations spanning clinical diagnostics, medical device, pharmaceutical, biotech and consumer product industries.&nbsp;

Prior to joining Velocity, Kim was the SVP of Human Resources at DNA Diagnostics Center (DDC), where she overhauled operational programs and leadership development to foster a culture aligned to company values and goals.&nbsp; The organizational transformation supported rapid growth and led to the successful acquisition by Eurofins in 2020.&nbsp; Before her time at DDC, Kim spent nearly 10 years as VP of Human Resources with Accriva Diagnostics, which was acquired by Werfen in 2017, and where she led the successful integration of Accriva into Instrumentation Laboratory, a Werfen Company.&nbsp;

With a philosophy that a company’s competitive advantage is its people, Kim believes that hands-on leadership has been an important part of her success.&nbsp; “Every company has its own unique set of challenges and opportunities” says Kim.&nbsp; “I believe that the role of Human Resources is to understand these dynamics and develop systems that bring out the best in our people.”

Outside of her corporate responsibilities, Kim also supports industry leaders with executive coaching and peer communication workshops.&nbsp; Her methods have been influential in building high performing leadership teams.&nbsp;
