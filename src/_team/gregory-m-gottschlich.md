When Greg takes a break you can usually find him outside, probably getting more exercise than you are. He has completed 16 marathons, two ultra marathons (we don't even know how far that is), and a half ironman\! He is also a pianist, currently working on Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. His daughter points out, however, that Greg's life is not perfect. He has been mowed over by snowboarders twice while skiing in Vail; one encounter resulted in a fractured leg. See? Not perfect.
