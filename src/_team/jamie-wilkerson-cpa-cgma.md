Velocity tapped Jamie to take the reins of financial operations in 2019 due to her deep experience in both finance and the research / clinical trials arena. After four years as an auditor at Deloitte and 10 years in finance at The Hamner Institute, Jamie moved into the clinical trials space as Chief Financial Officer at Clintrax Global and Director of Financial Planning at PRA Health Services. Jamie holds a MAC in Accounting and a BSBA in Business Administration, both from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In a fast-growing company, Jamie’s challenge is doing more than keeping the books. “As a finance professional, it’s not only making sure the numbers are accurate, but also making sure as a finance team we’re providing decision makers with the information they need to make the best strategic decisions.”

When Jamie is not crunching numbers she spends her time watching college sports with her family and going to the beach, activities shared by most card-carrying North Carolinians. However, since Jamie went to UNC and her husband graduated from N.C. State, game days can test the mettle of their marital civility – especially with their young son in the mix.
