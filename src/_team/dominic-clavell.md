Dominic joined Velocity Clinical Research in mid-2021 as Executive Vice President and General Manager for Velocity’s European division, the first employee for Velocity outside of the USA. &nbsp; &nbsp;The mission (if he chooses to accept it) to build an organisation of owned sites in Europe from the ground up was just enough incentive to attract him out of early retirement. &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to joining Velocity,&nbsp; Dominic spent nearly 30 years in the Pharma industry, split equally between top tier pharmaceutical companies and global CROs, as well as a stint as the International Director of Operations for Synexus. Most recently, Dominic served as Senior Vice President for Global Site Solutions and Early Phase Clinical Units at Parexel (formerly PAREXEL).

Dominic has been site-interfacing for his entire career, whether as a CRA, project manager, or responsible for building long-term strategic relationships with sites during his tenures at both IQVIA and Parexel. &nbsp; His time in these roles give Dominic a deep understanding the needs of both pharma and CROs need of when collaborating with clinical trial sites.&nbsp; These roles consequently, also give him a high degree of empathy for most of the pain points these organistions experience, and most importantly, a desire to make their experience pain-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

“It is early days for Velocity in Europe but the signs are very encouraging.&nbsp; Building a global organisation of high-performing sites with centralized command and control, and local, nuanced, patient recruitment solutions, to accelerate new medications to market….it is quite a mission”.&nbsp;

When time permits, Dom and his wife like to travel extensively.&nbsp; The fact that the majority of destinations visited also happen to make good wine is mere coincidence.
