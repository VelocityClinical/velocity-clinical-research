Dominic joined Velocity Clinical Research in mid-2021 as Executive VP and General Manager for Velocity’s European division. He is Velocity’s first employee outside of the U.S. The mission (if he chooses to accept it), to build an organization of owned sites in Europe from the ground up, was just enough incentive to attract him out of early retirement. Prior to joining Velocity, Dom spent nearly 30 years in the pharma industry. His tenure was split equally between top-tier pharmaceutical companies and global CROs, and included a stint at Synexus as the International Director of Operations. Most recently, Dom served as Senior VP for Global Site Solutions and Early Phase Clinical Units at Parexel (formerly PAREXEL).

Dominic has been site-facing for his entire career. He has been both a CRA and project manager, and was responsible for building long-term strategic relationships with sites during his tenures at IQVIA and Parexel. Dom has a deep understanding of the needs of pharma and CROs when collaborating with clinical trial sites, and he also understands and appreciates the challenges of managing a high-volume, high-quality clinical site. Dom has a high degree of empathy for the pain points at sites, and, most importantly, a desire to make their experience as pain-free as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

“It is early days for Velocity in Europe but the signs are very encouraging.&nbsp; Building a global organisation of high-performing sites with centralized command and control and local, nuanced, patient recruitment solutions, to accelerate new medications to market….it is quite a mission”.&nbsp;

When time permits, Dom and his wife like to travel extensively.&nbsp; The fact that the majority of destinations visited also happen to make good wine is mere coincidence.
